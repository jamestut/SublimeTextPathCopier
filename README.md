# Sublime Text Path Copier Extension

This extension provides these additional options in tab's context menu:

- **Copy File Name**  
  Copies the file name only of the file. For example, if the opened file resides in `/path/to/file.txt`, then `file.txt` will be copied.
- **Copy Relative Path**  
  Available only when the Sublime Text window is opening a folder. Copies the path of the selected file relative to currently opened folder's name. For example, if the current window is opening folder `/the/folder`, and the file resides in `/the/folder/subdir/file.txt`, then `subdir/file.txt` will be copied.
- **Copy Absolute Path**  
  Copies the absolute path of the opened file.
